# Not sure if this will affect things in the submission, but I installed numpy to my conda environment, so if you're running into issues, write >python s in the search bar
# and click Python: select interpreter. It should let you pick the right environment from there. Although, this is almost certainly a local usage thing, so it probably isn't an issue.
