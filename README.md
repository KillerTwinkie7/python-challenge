Read data from budget_data.csv and election_data.csv

I did the majority of this without using anyone else's code, although I was running into some issues getting the directories of the .csv files and output files. I wasn't really sure how to account for the fact that directories can be wildly different, and I didn't want to hard-code it. I finally found a solution that worked for me at https://codeigo.com/python/get-directory-of-a-file/, and I made sure to include that link in the notes of the main.py files as well.
